# Project 5: Capstone

The Capstone Project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

## Detect the location of keypoints on face images

This project is an implement of the competition Ficial Keypoints Detection on kaggle.

The competition URL is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection

My file is `Capstone Report.html` and `Capstone Report.ipynb`.

Data is too large, so I don't upload to the github, but I offer the data source link in the jupyter file.

My python library use are:

- os
- time
- zipfile
- pandas
- numpy
- tensorflow
- six
- sklearn
- matplotlib
