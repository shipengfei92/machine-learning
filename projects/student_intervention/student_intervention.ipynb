    "- Support Vector Machine\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General applications\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a method for supervised learning. Margin is very important for it. SVM find the linear separator that has the largest margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is a useful method for classification. SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "- Have a strong founding theory\n",
    "- It scales relatively well to high dimensional data\n",
    "-  Tradeoff between classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly\n",
    "- Fewer hyperparameters. Generally SVMs require less grid-searching to get a reasonably accurate model. SVM with a RBF kernel usually performs quite well.\n",
    "- Global optimum guaranteed, training is relatively easy.\n",
    "- Non-traditional data like strings and trees can be used as input to SVM, instead of feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "- Need a “good” kernel function to map the data, in order to separate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why choose this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the kernel trick \"rbf\", SVM can efficiently separate the features and do well in high dimentional space, so I use the SVM for a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are excellent tools for making financial or number based decisions where a lot of complex information needs to be taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation.\n",
    "- The best feature of using trees for analytics - easy to interpret and explain to executives.\n",
    "- Decision trees are able to generate understandable rules. \n",
    "- Decision trees perform classification without requiring much computation. \n",
    "- Decision trees are able to handle both continuous and categorical variables. \n",
    "- Decision trees provide a clear indication of which fields are most important for prediction or classification. \n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can easily overfit.\n",
    "- Decision trees do not treat well non-rectangular regions. \n",
    "- Decision trees are less appropriate for estimation tasks where the goal is to predict the value of a continuous attribute. \n",
    "#### Why choose this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to the simplicity of understanding and the suitable for classification problems with many features, so I chose the decision tree for a try. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes is one of the fastest learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- An advantage of naive Bayes is that it only requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.\n",
    "- Its learning speed is independent from the dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the features are not independent, the performance of the naive bayes will be poor.\n",
    "- It's difficult to the data with zero-frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why choose this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive bayes thinks different features are independent, so it can quickly classify the data and save time. By the results we can also see whether the different features are really independent.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
